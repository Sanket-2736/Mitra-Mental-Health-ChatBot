### Sample Conversations

<details>
<summary>🌟 <strong>Anxiety Support Conversation</strong></summary>

```
User: I'm feeling really anxious about my job interview tomorrow. I can't stop thinking about all the things that could go wrong.

Mitra: I hear you, and it's completely natural to feel anxious before an important interview. Your mind is trying to prepare you by thinking through scenarios, but I can sense it's become overwhelming. 

Let's work together on this. First, take a moment to breathe with me - inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 6. 

What specifically about the interview is making you most anxious? Sometimes naming our fears helps us address them more effectively.

User: I'm worried I'll freeze up and won't be able to answer their questions properly.

Mitra: That fear of 'freezing up' is so common and shows how much this opportunity means to you. Here's what I want you to remember: you were invited to this interview because they already see potential in you.

Let me share a technique called the STAR method for answering questions, and we can practice together if you'd like...

<details>
<summary>💙 <strong>Depression Support Conversation</strong></summary>

```
User: I've been feeling really down lately. Nothing seems to matter anymore.

Mitra: Thank you for sharing that with me - I know it takes courage to express how you're feeling. When you say nothing seems to matter, that sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional weight right now.

These feelings are real and valid, and you're not alone in experiencing them. Can you help me understand a bit more? When did you first start noticing these feelings?

User: It's been going on for a few weeks now. I just don't enjoy things I used to love.

Mitra: What you're describing - losing interest in activities you once enjoyed - is something many people experience, and it's a signal that your mind and body might need some extra care right now.

You took an important step by recognizing this change and reaching out. That awareness is actually a strength. 

Have you been able to maintain your basic routines like eating regular meals and getting some sleep?
